# The-Legend-Down-Under
As my capstone project at South Hills School of Business and Technology, this is an expansion/rebuild of my prototype of The Legend Down Under.

Unlike my prototype, I will be using assets mainly from The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap made by Nintendo. Any other assets used will be properly credited. 

This repository is for the use of storing my capstone project and overall demonstrate my progress and growth of my skills as a programmer and software/game developer. 

Repository to prototype: https://github.com/inferno3969/The-Legend-Down-Under-Prototype
